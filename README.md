# twitch_chat_listener
Real time sentiment analysis on Twitch chat messages.

This project gives shape to a tool called Twitch Chat Listener, capable of performing real-time sentiment 
analysis and providing streamers with the ability to analyze, extract knowledge, react to the polarity of 
sentiment (rejection, indifference or welcome) of the comments that their viewers are sharing through the 
streaming chat and, ultimately, maximize audience loyalty and revenue generation.

Keywords: Twitch; live streaming; streamer; IRC chat; natural language processing (NLP); sentiment analysis; 
non-relational database; web scrapping; dashboard; Docker containers.
